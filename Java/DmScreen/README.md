# DMScreen: The Ultimate TTRPG Companion

## Project Synopsis
DMScreen is an ongoing passion project born from the necessity of streamlining the 
game master's experience in TTRPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. As a game master, I 
found myself juggling numerous notes, resources, and materials across different 
platforms. This project is my solution: a single, comprehensive program designed to 
centralize everything needed to organize, build, and run a campaign.

My goal is to create a dynamic tool that evolves with the feedback of the TTRPG 
community. As I continue to pour my passion into creating new worlds and stories, 
DMScreen will grow to become the best companion for storytellers everywhere.

## Features
While DMScreen is still in its early stages, the following features are planned for 
future development:

### Campaign Management: 
Organize sessions, manage plots, and track a campaign's progress in a centralized 
location.

### Worldbuilding 
Tools: Create and manage unique worlds, including pantheons, factions, and locations.

### Session-Ready Compendium: 
A searchable database for quick access to rules, spells, monsters, and items.

### Player and NPC Tracking: 
Keep detailed notes on characters, their motivations, and their relationships.

### Customizable Content: 
Easily add your own homebrew rules, monsters, and items.

## How to Get Started
DMScreen is currently under active development and is not yet set up to run outside 
of a development environment (IDE).

### To explore the project, you will need to:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Install any required dependencies as specified in the project documentation.
4. Run the application from your IDE.

I will provide a complete, standalone build of DMScreen as soon as it's ready for 
general use.

## Contributing
I believe the best tools are built with the help of the community. If you are a 
developer, a TTRPG enthusiast, or a fellow storyteller, your feedback and contributions
