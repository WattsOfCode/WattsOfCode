/*  Name: John Deardorff
    Date of Development: 2025-06-26
    Assignment: SDC230 Performance Assessment - Loops & Calculations
    Description: This class demonstrates the use of 
    counter-controlled and condition-based loops to perform calculations.
    Instructions:
    Incorporate the following requirements into your application:
â€¢	The program will consist of one file - the main application class
        Name the class/file App.java
        Include documentation at the top of the file that includes
            Your name
            Date of development
            Assignment (e.g., SDC230 Performance Assessment - Loops & Calculations)
            Description of the class
	The main application class must meet the following requirements
        Print a line that states "Your Name - Week 2 PA Loops & Calculations"
        Demonstrate a counter-controlled loop
            Calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to 10
            Print the running total
            Print the final total 
        Demonstrate a condition-based loop
            Ask the user to enter an integer value (-1 to quit)
            Keep a running sum of the values
            Keep a count of how many values the user has entered
            Print the running total after each entry
            Print the final sum of all values entered
            Print a count of the values entered
